# 🏎️ Forumla 1 Standings App

This project was created in Kotlin as an assignment for my Mobile Development class (start of 2023). It uses real Formula 1 data and you can see the current positions of drivers as well as constructor positions. Besides that, you can check out the Races tab where you can find basic information about each race track on the calendar.

## 🛠️ Technologies and tools

- `Kotlin`
- `Android Studio`
- `Unit tests`
- `REST API call (OkHttpClient)`

## 📚 What I learned

As this was my first time using and learning Kotlin, I learned how to create simple Android applications and display real data in them. I used the real F1 data about drivers, constructors, and race tracks from [RapidApi](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-formula-1). I learned how to create a fetching service for this API with `OkHttpClient`, and use that data through the Adapter to display it in their views. Since this was the first time building a project like this, I learned how to create various mobile app layouts and containers using Kotlin Fragments and displaying them in View. Based on 

## 💭 How can this project be improved?

As this is a fairly simple app there are a lot of things that could be improved.

- Implement personal account features with Firebase.
- Create a view to display news from the Formula 1 world.
- Add some kind of Add to favorite option for drivers/constructors/race tracks
